Hello and thank you for downloading nview, and double thanks if you are actually reading it inside the program.
This is designed as a very basic text viewer so that eople just learning C can both learn the code and a library
so that they can write interesting programs perhaps based on this source code.

The program is always used like this.

./nview <filename> <colour>

the colour codes are these:
a - aqua/cyan
b - blue
g - green
r - red
p - purple/magenta
y - yellow
w - white

NOTE: you may open a file without defining a colour(default is green) but not vice versa(this could probably be
implemented in less the five minutes but to be honest I like to limit this collection to a few hours each and one
a day)

To compile on *nix operating systems you need one past Unix System V (mid 1980s) with NCurses, although removing the n from ncurses
would make the compilation possible with regular curses on older unix systems and on windows 9X+ with PDcurses.

To compile on Linux and similar *nix platforms simply run the makefile through GNU make and you will have your executable.

If you are running windows, change the part that says '-lncurses' to '-lpdcurses'(provided you have the libraryinstalled) and then run it through
mingw-make and you will have a working executable provided you have pdcurses.dll in the folder or you make it statically linked

On older *nix and early home computers with support for the curses library change '-lncurses' to '-lcurses' and It will work.

thanks for at least having a look at this, and don't forget to make the window reasonably large otherwise you won't see the whole document
